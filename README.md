# NHLP Replication

## Goal:

Replicate GWAS hit in a second cohort and model the SNPxAge Interaction

## Brief Explanation:

We discovered a series of SNPs that were associated with decoding performance, an early predictor of reading ability. When we went to replicate our results, we were only able to replicate if we age matched the cohort. Here I am investigating if there is an interaction between top SNP and age
